# Resume_V1
A two-columned resume created in LaTeX using [LianTze Lim's](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) Overleaf LaTeX template for inspiration. 

Originally, I created a beautiful and simple resume on Enhancv.com.

<a href="" target="blank"><img align="center" src="https://github.com/zeshanbasaran/Resume_V1/assets/116126778/546bc7c6-3619-4892-aaf1-0b2afec760ef" alt="zeshanbasaran" width="500" /></a>

Yet I did not realize until after creating it that I would have to pay a lot of money to remove the watermark from the bottom of the page.

So, I set out to create the same resume in LaTeX using [LianTze Lim's](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) Overleaf LaTeX template as a guide to achieve the design I wanted without spending my dough.

Here is the result:
